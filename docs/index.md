NCI is a lightweight library to create UI on the terminal in a fast way to provide
a better experience using complex commands and consuming the outputs creating
text-based user interfaces and a easy way to interact with any binary. In the
following sections you can learn more about the different widgets and its
behavior. Each section have a full description of each type of widget and
the requirements used to desing and develop them.

The most basic unit to draw scenes is the character. You cannot use pixels or similar,
but NCI provide some helpers to give library users all they need to create scenes.
