# Inputs

In NCI you will find selectables and not selectables widgets. You cannot interact with
not selectables widgets. Selectables widgets widgets are highlighted when are selected
and have the focus and, by default, pressing `F1` or `h` will render a Popup with all
the keys to use the widget.

These are the most common shortcuts:

- Refresh: `r`
- Open this help: `h`
- Close dialog: `Esc` / `q`
- Next: `j` / `Space`
- Previous: `k` / `Shift + Space`
- Open/Close: `o` / `Enter`
- Edit: `e`

## Ideas or possible shortcuts to develop

- Focus next: `n`
- Focus previous: `p`
